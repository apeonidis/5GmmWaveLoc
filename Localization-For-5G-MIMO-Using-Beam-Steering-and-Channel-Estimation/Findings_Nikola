Findings about the python simulation: 

1. Well structured and comprehensive PDF.
2. They use only ULA (everythong is in a plane, rather than space).
3. Combination of beem steering and chanel estimation.
4. I finally think I understood what channel matrix and response vectors are.
5. The implementation of Channel Estimation Localization is not working - even with no noise it is not barely acurate. 
6. Ideas for further actions 
  6.1 Try to debug the Channel Estimation Localization 
  6.2 If 6.1 is successfull
     6.2.1 Try to implement URL (cover the whole space instead of a plane)
     6.2.3 Fully implement the solution with beam switching and determine if it adds accuracy
